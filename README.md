# Meuseum-of-candy
Hi, the whole Idea for this project Meusem Of Candy is that, it is a fictional instagram mueseum.
I went for a sort of trendy look minimal life passed out color and some photos that I find out on https://unsplash.com/. This website doesn't say much it is just a way to showcase my HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills.
What I did here is that I made a website which showcase different kind of candy.
# How I Made This
*I used HTML to make a basic layout, there is 2 parts in the body, First is navbar <nav> and second <section> is section. Navbar contains logo and menu. Section contains the content of website.
*I used style.css for basic styling of the website
*I used javascript and jquery to make background of navbar change when it is scrolled
*I used Bootstrap 4 through cdn to make website responsive
*I took Nunito font from google fonts for basic font of website.
